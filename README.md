# eshujupai
Eshujupai is intended for the research and backtesting of trading strategies, rather than for direct application in live trading.

"Eshujupai" is a Python-based web platform designed for predicting the buy/sell prices of various asset classes. Users can either upload their own historical data or integrate with a historical data API. The platform then processes this data using a combination of technical indicators, statistical models, and machine learning algorithms to generate predictions. A key feature is the ability to compare the Profit and Loss (PnL) generated by different prediction methods, with the results visually displayed on the webpage. Furthermore, "Eshujupai" is designed for extensibility, allowing users to easily integrate and test their own custom prediction methodologies.
